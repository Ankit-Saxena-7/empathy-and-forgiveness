Studies show that people are more forgiving when primed with questions or social prompts that require them to put themselves into the other person's shoes. But, how do racial differences of the transgressor factor into an individual's ability to forgive and how do these differences affect policy decisions in judicial rulings, police officer training, and corporate applications for managers and employees? To answer these questions, our team developed a randomized control study, where individuals were primed with an act of transgression, then were shown an individual's face, either of the same race or of a different race as them, and then were measured on their forgiveness levels, either by first priming them with empathy or not. The observed null results suggested that we do not have enough evidence to conclude that there is a difference between peopleâ€™s level of forgiveness when primed with different race groups. These null effects gave us a deeper understanding of how individuals perceive in-group and out-group identities when presented with pictures of people. We conclude with possible explanations for the observed null effects for race-related priming and discuss interesting age- and gender-related effects that were observed in our analyses.
